A project from The Odin Project Intermediate HTML and CSS Course: https://www.theodinproject.com/lessons/node-path-intermediate-html-and-css-sign-up-form

## Goal
Create a webpage with a large background image and logo on the left and a sign-up form on the right.

Basic HTML, CSS and JavaScript (for form validation) completed 21/10/22.

### To-dos:
The project is finished, but I am considering extending it as follows:
1. Make a "form submitted" confirmation appear on form submission
2. Employ regexes in inputs to require correct formatting of email and phone number
3. Employ regex to require a strong password
